## Cloud Engineer

As a Cloud Engineer, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable cloud solutions using cutting-edge technologies. I am proficient in leveraging AWS services such as Lambda Functions, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS SAM to build robust serverless architectures that meet the dynamic needs of modern applications. My expertise extends to GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Python for backend development, and JavaScript for frontend design.

Continuously striving for professional growth, I am expanding my skills to include infrastructure as code (IaC) practices with Terraform. By mastering Terraform, I aim to streamline cloud resource management and deployment processes, ensuring consistency, reliability, and efficiency across projects.
