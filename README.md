## Software Engineer


As a Software Engineer, I specialize in building user-focused applications and scalable solutions. With a strong Python and JavaScript foundation, I develop full-stack applications using modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and FastAPI. My expertise extends to designing efficient system architectures, including monolithic systems and microservices, and leveraging cloud platforms like AWS and Firebase for deployment and scalability.

Continuously striving for professional growth, I am expanding my expertise in AI technologies. During the Headstarter Fellowship, I focused on integrating AI APIs such as Google Gemini AI, AWS Bedrock, and Pinecone to develop impactful applications. This experience enhanced my ability to design intelligent, scalable solutions that solve real-world challenges effectively.
